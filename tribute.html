            <h2>Who was he?</h2>
            <p>Subhas Chandra Bose 23 January 1897 18 August 1945 was an Indian nationalist whose defiance of British
                authority in India made him a hero among Indians, but his wartime alliances with Nazi Germany and
                Fascist Japan left a legacy vexed by authoritarianism,anti-Semitism,and military failure. The honorific
                Netaji (Hindustani: "Respected Leader") was first applied to Bose in Germany in early 1942—by the Indian
                soldiers of the Indische Legion and by the German and Indian officials in the Special Bureau for India
                in Berlin. It is now used throughout India.</p>
            <p>As a firm believer of Bhagwat Gita, Subhash Chandra Bose believed that it was a great inspiration for the
                fight against the British.
                Subhash Chandra Bose is one of the legendary national heroes of India.
                “The Great Indian Struggle” is a book written by Neta Ji to explain the Indian Independence Movement’s
                history.
